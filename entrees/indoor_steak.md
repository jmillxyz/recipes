# Indoor Steak

## Ingredients
* 1 Tbsp vegetable/avocado oil

1. 1 hr before cooking, remove steak from fridge, pat dry with paper towel, and salt generously on both sides.
2. Heat cast iron or carbon steel skillet at medium-high heat. When hot, add avocado oil, and move around the pan.
3. Once the oil is shimmering (10-20 sec), add the steak. Cook for ~4 min.
4. Flip and cook for another 4 min. Let rest for 5 min before cutting.

## Discussion

### Why inside?
My apartment has a grill, but
1) it's underpowered,
2) always out of gas, and
3) swarming with mosquitos
...so I wanted a better way to cook one inside.

### Which oils?
Vegetable oil has a smoke point of 510°F and avocado oil has one of 520°F. By using oils that can go hotter before burning, we prevent the inevitable smoke alarm going off.

Butter's milk proteins burn easily at high or sustained heat -- its low smoke point (350°F) means your kitchen would be full of smoke and your steak would probably not taste as good.
